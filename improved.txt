Jayse, 

I was hoping this would be a great opportunity to help you and to be able to get some more experience in the field doing what I love to do.
I was making plans to find a way to move to Greenville, so I wouldn't have to drive so far.
I already quit my job, and waited a week to hear from you. 

I know the test didnâ€™t go super well since it's been a while since I reviewed, however, I am
a very quick learner and this is what I love to do every day.
I'm willing to take the test again and show you what I can do.

make in minecraft:
- put a comparator next to a collection chest of an automatic collector (example: iron)
then based on how much iron is in the chest, the comparator will put out a signal and
if that signal is strong enough, it will power a minecart to take to the automatic sorter.
